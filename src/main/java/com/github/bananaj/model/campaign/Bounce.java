/**
 * Class representing bounce counts for a campaign
 * <p>
 * Bounces occur when an email can't be delivered to an email address. When an
 * email bounces, it is classified as either a soft or a hard bounce.
 * <p>
 * Mailchimp recognizes two types of bounces, and we handle them differently.
 * Hard bounces happen when an email can't be delivered. This can be caused by
 * an invalid email address or an unexpected error during sending.
 * <p>
 * Soft bounces are recognized by the email server, but are returned to the
 * sender because the mailbox is either full or temporarily unavailable.
